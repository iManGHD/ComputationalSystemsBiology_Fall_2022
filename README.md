# ComputationalSystemsBiology_Fall_2022
In this repository, you'll find a collection of all my projects, homework assignments, and resources from the Computational Systems Biology course that I took in my third semester of master's at Sharif University of Technology. This course was taught by Prof. Babak Khalaj and Prof. Mojtaba Tefagh from the Department of Computer Engineering.
